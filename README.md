## API

  `var kill = require('kill')`

### kill(pid, signal = 'SIGTERM')

  Kill the process with the given PID.

  Returns undefined.

  If the arguments are of the wrong types, an appropriate TypeError will be thrown.

  If `kill(3)` returns an error, an error annotated with `syscall`, `code`, `errno` and `pid` will be thrown.
  Commonly, it'll return the codes `EPERM` (permission denied) and `ESRCH` (no such process).
